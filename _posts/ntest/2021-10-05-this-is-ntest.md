# What is Postman API Test

Postman is an application used for API testing. It is an HTTP client that tests HTTP requests, utilizing a graphical user interface, through which we obtain different types of responses that need to be subsequently validated. 

<br>

# Methods

Postman offers many endpoint interaction methods. The following are some of the most used, including their functions:

GET: Obtain information 
POST: Add information
PUT: Replace information
PATCH: Update certain information
DELETE: Delete information

# Response Codes

When testing APIs with Postman, we usually obtain different response codes. Some of the most common include:

100 Series > Temporal responses, for example, ‘102 Processing’.
200 Series > Responses where the client accepts the request and the server processes it successfully, for instance, ‘200 Ok’.
300 Series  > Responses related to URL redirection, for example, ‘301 Moved Permanently.’
400 Series  > Client error responses, for instance, ‘400 Bad Request’.
500 Series > Server error responses, for example, ‘500 Internal Server Error.’
